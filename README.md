# COVID19-Analytics

Project Description:

This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, encompassing various stages of data processing and examination. The key steps include:

Data Understanding: We started by thoroughly understanding the COVID-19 dataset, identifying key variables, and assessing its structure and content.

Data Cleaning: To ensure accuracy, we cleaned the data by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

Descriptive Statistics: We performed descriptive statistical analysis to summarize the central tendencies, variability, and distribution patterns within the data.

Time Series Analysis: We conducted time series analysis to study the temporal patterns in COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and fatalities, forecasting future trends.

Geographical Analysis: The project also includes a geographical analysis, mapping the spread of the virus across different regions and visualizing the impact on a global scale.

Correlational Analysis: We explored the relationships between different variables through correlation analysis, identifying significant associations and patterns.

Advanced Analysis: Advanced statistical and machine learning techniques were applied to uncover deeper insights, such as predicting trends and outcomes.

This project aims to provide a holistic view of the COVID-19 pandemic through rigorous data analysis, offering valuable insights into its dynamics and effects.
